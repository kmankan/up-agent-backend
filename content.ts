Accounts
Up Bank offers simple, fee-free personal banking accounts designed for everyday use and saving. There are no monthly account-keeping fees and accounts can be opened in minutes via the mobile app​
UP.COM.AU
. Eligible individuals aged 16 or over can sign up with as little as $1 to open an account (no minimum ongoing balance)​
UP.COM.AU
. Key account types include:

Up Everyday Account: A digital transaction account for day-to-day spending. It comes with a Mastercard debit card (including Apple Pay and Google Pay support​
SAVINGS.COM.AU
) and full banking features like BPAY bill payments, direct debits, and instant payments via PayID/Osko. There are no account fees, no ATM fees charged by Up (ATM operator fees may apply), and no foreign transaction fees for purchases overseas or online​
SMONEY.COM.AU
. The Mastercard exchange rate is passed on with 0% markup for international transactions​
UP.COM.AU
. (Up previously charged a $5 fee for overseas ATM withdrawals, but this has been removed​
UP.COM.AU
.) The Everyday Account does not pay interest (it’s a pure spending account).

Up Saver Account: A high-interest savings account linked to the Everyday account. Up Saver has no fees and offers a competitive interest rate of 4.35% p.a. on balances up to $1,000,000, provided you meet the monthly usage condition​
MOZO.COM.AU
. The interest is calculated daily and paid monthly. To qualify for the maximum rate, you must make at least 5 successful card purchases in a month using your Up debit card (ATM withdrawals don’t count)​
MOZO.COM.AU
. If this condition isn’t met (or for any portion of balance above $1m), the interest rate reverts to 0% p.a.​
MOZO.COM.AU
. The Saver account is very flexible – you can instantly create multiple named “Savers” to bucket your money for different goals (up to 50 savings buckets per customer are allowed)​
UP.COM.AU
. Savers can be funded via instant transfers from the Everyday account, scheduled payments, or round-ups (where purchases are rounded to the next dollar and the spare change is automatically saved)​
REDDIT.COM
. There is no fixed term – you can transfer money in or out of Savers anytime with no penalties​
MOZO.COM.AU
.

2Up Joint Account: Up’s take on joint banking, nicknamed “2Up”, allows two people to manage shared finances easily. Unlike a traditional joint account that replaces individual accounts, 2Up is structured as a shared account layer in addition to each person’s own accounts​
UP.COM.AU
. Both partners keep their separate Up Everyday and Saver accounts, and open a 2Up shared spending account (and optional shared Savers) together. The 2Up account has the same features as the Everyday account (supporting direct debits, transfers, Apple/Google Pay, etc.)​
SAVINGS.COM.AU
. Each person gets their own in-app avatar and can see who made each transaction in the joint feed​
THEURBANLIST.COM
. Savings in any joint Savers also earn the up to 4.35% interest under the same conditions (with a separate $1M cap for the joint Savers)​
UP.COM.AU
. This modern joint account is ideal for couples or housemates – you can easily contribute a percentage of income or certain amounts to 2Up for shared expenses, while keeping the rest of your finances separate​
REDDIT.COM
. Opening a 2Up account is free and can be done in-app by inviting your “Player 2”. (Both users must be Up customers.)

All Up accounts are digital-first and managed through the Up mobile app. There are no monthly fees on any account, and standard transactions (EFTPOS, online, direct debits, etc.) are free. Up’s accounts use the infrastructure of Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, so account details (BSB/Account Number) are issued under Bendigo’s banking license. Deposits are protected by the Australian Government’s $250,000 guarantee per customer as Bendigo is an ADI (Authorized Deposit-taking Institution). In summary, Up’s account lineup is straightforward: an everyday spending account with a linked high-interest saver, plus an innovative joint account option – all with zero fees and a focus on helping customers save.

Features
Up distinguishes itself with a feature-rich mobile app that helps users manage money effortlessly. The platform includes numerous smart tools for budgeting, payments, and saving:

Automated Spending Insights: Every transaction is auto-categorised into detailed spending categories (Up has around 40 categories)​
UP.COM.AU
​
UP.COM.AU
. The app provides visual insights such as weekly spending reports and monthly summaries to help you understand where your money goes​
UP.COM.AU
. You can see how much you spend at specific merchants or in certain categories over time. Up also introduced Custom date range reports, so you can align spending insights with your pay cycle or any interval​
UP.COM.AU
. These analytics give users a clear picture of their habits and nudge better budgeting.

Budgeting Tools (Trackers): Users can set up Trackers to monitor spending in any category (or combination of categories) against a limit they choose​
UP.COM.AU
. For example, you could track “Dining Out” and get notified if you’re nearing your monthly budget. This helps keep discretionary spending in check. The app will alert you as you approach or exceed your set targets. Essentially, Up acts like a personal finance coach by actively tracking budgets and advising you in real time.

Multiple Savers & Round-ups: Up makes it easy to save for goals. You can instantly create multiple Saver sub-accounts and give each a name, emoji, and even a cover image. This allows bucketed saving (e.g. one Saver for "Holiday", another for "Emergency Fund", etc.)​
UP.COM.AU
. Automated round-up rules can be enabled on the Everyday account – each purchase can be rounded up to the nearest $1 (or $5, etc.), with the spare change sent to a Saver of your choice​
REDDIT.COM
. Round-ups are customizable and help boost savings in the background without effort. You can also schedule automatic transfers (e.g. send $50/week to a Saver) or use one-tap Forward actions to move money into savings whenever you like​
UP.COM.AU
. Conversely, if you need to dip into savings for spending, Up offers Covers – a feature that lets you instantly transfer money from a Saver to your Everyday account to “cover” a purchase after it’s made​
UP.COM.AU
. (This is effectively an overdraft protection using your own savings, with no fees.) These tools work together to encourage saving and prevent accidental overdraws.

Pay Day and Upcoming Bills: Up introduced a Pay Day feature that gives a forward-looking view of your finances. You can input or let the app detect your salary schedule. The app then calculates how much of your balance is safe to spend until next payday, after accounting for upcoming bills or scheduled transfers​
UP.COM.AU
. It detects regular payments (like subscriptions or rent) from your transaction history and marks them as upcoming bills. This way, Up can show a “forecast” balance or dynamic bank balance (coined as a Pay Day balance) that subtracts known future expenses. This helps customers avoid overspending by making invisible obligations visible. Pay Day essentially answers “how much can I spend right now without running short later?”. It’s a unique spin on balance that alleviates the guesswork between pay cycles​
UP.COM.AU
.

Bill Splitting and Sharing: Up makes it simple to split expenses with friends. The app allows you to split a transaction and request money from another person (they don’t necessarily need to use Up – it can generate a payment link or you can send via PayID). Notably, all these features remain available even when you use a 2Up joint account – your personal round-ups, savers, and pay splitting still work alongside the joint account​
UP.COM.AU
. In a 2Up account, each partner’s contributions are visible, and you can easily share the cost of any purchase. This focus on collaborative finance is an innovation for couples managing money together.

Fast Payments (NPP): Up supports real-time payments via the New Payments Platform. You can set up a PayID (like your phone number or email) for your Up account and receive money instantly from any bank that supports Osko/PayID​
UP.COM.AU
. Outgoing transfers via PayID or to other banks using Osko are near-instant 24/7 as well. This means sending or receiving money through Up is as fast as texting, with no delays even outside business hours​
UP.COM.AU
. Up also supports traditional BSB/account number transfers and BPAY for bills (those follow normal clearing times if the other bank isn’t on Osko). Essentially, Up offers full modern payments capabilities, ensuring you can pay anyone, anytime.

Card and Digital Wallets: Every Up Everyday account comes with a Mastercard debit card (a vibrant coral-colored physical card). The card supports contactless payments and works worldwide wherever Mastercard is accepted. From day one, Up has supported Apple Pay and Google Pay for convenient mobile payments​
SAVINGS.COM.AU
. You can add your digital card to your smartphone or smartwatch wallet and tap to pay. Up also supports other wallets like Samsung Pay, Garmin Pay and Fitbit Pay for wide device compatibility (allowing users to pay via phones, watches, or other wearables). The Up app provides instant push notifications for every card transaction, so you can immediately see when a purchase or ATM withdrawal is made. Security features include the ability to lock/unlock your card instantly in-app if it’s lost or stolen, change your card PIN in-app, and request a new card if needed. The physical card details are accessible in-app (the card’s number, CVV, expiry), which means the card itself doesn’t show the number – a security measure to protect card info if the card is lost. Up’s card has no foreign currency fees or conversion fees as mentioned, making it excellent for travel and online shopping in other currencies​
SMONEY.COM.AU
.

International Money Transfers: For sending money overseas, Up has partnered with Wise (formerly TransferWise) to integrate international transfers seamlessly. Through the Up app, you can transfer funds to foreign bank accounts in dozens of currencies using Wise’s service. This gives you the real exchange rate (mid-market rate) and low fees that Wise offers, with no additional fees charged by Up on top​
UP.COM.AU
. Essentially, Up acts as a front-end for Wise: you initiate the transfer in Up, but the money is sent via your linked Wise account (you set this up once in-app). This means you get fast, cheap international payments without leaving the Up app. There are no SWIFT fees or hefty bank charges – just Wise’s transparent fee. For example, sending AUD to USD or EUR is far cheaper and quicker than a typical bank wire. This feature makes Up stand out for users with international payment needs. (Inbound international transfers are also possible via Wise or traditional methods using Bendigo’s SWIFT details.)

Automation & Integrations: As a digital-native bank, Up integrates with technology to simplify banking. You can connect Up with Siri voice commands – for instance, ask Siri to check your balance or to transfer money to one of your Savers​
UP.COM.AU
. The integration uses Siri Shortcuts on iOS for hands-free banking. Up also has an Open Banking API compatibility, allowing you to share your data securely with other financial apps if you choose (per Australia’s CDR/Open Banking regulations). Additionally, Up’s developers have experimented with creative features like generating personalized Spotify playlists based on your spending categories (a fun campaign they ran), showcasing their tech-savvy culture. While Up is app-only, they provide web receipts for transactions (so when you purchase online, you might get a smart receipt in-app with the merchant’s logo and info). They also allow exports of data for budgeting apps. New features are continually added – for example, “Auto-Covers” (in testing as of late 2022) will automatically move money from a Saver to your main account if a transaction would have overdrawn your balance​
UP.COM.AU
, preventing declines without needing an overdraft facility. Overall, Up’s feature set is very robust for a bank of its size, often surpassing traditional banks in usability. Its focus is on making banking easy and even enjoyable – giving users insights and control over their money, both at home and abroad.

Home Loans
In 2022, Up expanded into home loans, bringing its digital-first philosophy to mortgages. Up Home Loans are offered in partnership with parent company Bendigo and Adelaide Bank (the loans are funded by Bendigo, with Up providing the tech and interface). The launch was a “soft launch” in late 2022, and since then uptake has grown rapidly (Bendigo reported a fourfold increase in Up home loan volumes over one half-year after launch)​
BENDIGOADELAIDE.COM.AU
. Up’s home loan product is designed to be simple, competitive, and ideal for first-home buyers​
MOZO.COM.AU
. Key features and details include:

Competitive Interest Rates: Up introduced a variable interest rate that was among the lowest in the market. Initially the variable owner-occupier rate was 5.95% p.a. (principal-and-interest)​
SAVINGS.COM.AU
, which was noted as the lowest variable rate at the time. This has since increased slightly with market movements (to about 6.00% p.a. as of early 2024)​
SAVINGS.COM.AU
. The rates are transparent and apply to all eligible customers (Up doesn’t use complicated risk-based pricing for individuals – if you qualify for the loan, you get the advertised rate). Up also offers fixed rate options for those who prefer rate certainty – fixed terms of 1, 2, or 3 years have been available, after which the loan reverts to the standard variable rate (currently ~6.00% p.a. for P&I)​
UP.COM.AU
. Notably, Up’s home loan rates have won awards – in 2024, Up Home won Mozo Experts Choice awards for Best Offset Home Loan and Best Fixed Home Loan (Owner-Occupier), particularly highlighting its great value for first home buyers​
MOZO.COM.AU
.

No Fees & Flexible Repayments: True to Up’s no-fuss ethos, the home loans come with no application fee, no ongoing monthly fees, and no fee for extra repayments. There are also no offset account fees (offset functionality is free – more below) and free redraw on any advance payments​
UP.COM.AU
. This means borrowers can pay extra to get ahead on their loan and withdraw those extra funds at any time without penalty. There’s also no early payoff fee for variable loans (fixed loans may have break costs if paid out early, as usual). Overall, Up has minimized the typical charges associated with mortgages, aiming to keep it fair and straightforward.

Offset Accounts (Savers as Offsets): A headline feature of Up’s home loan is the way it leverages Up’s Savers as offset accounts. Each Up home loan can have multiple 100% offset accounts linked – in fact, Up allows up to 50 offset accounts at no cost​
UP.COM.AU
. In practice, these are simply your Up Savers (and even your everyday account) which automatically act as offsets to your loan balance. Every dollar you keep in those linked accounts reduces the interest charged on your home loan by the same amount, completely offsetting at the full loan interest rate. This is a unique offering: most banks limit you to one offset account (often with fees or requirements), but Up lets you utilize many. For example, you could keep your “Emergency Fund” Saver and “Travel Fund” Saver, etc., and all their balances offset your mortgage interest – yet you still earn the equivalent benefit of the home loan rate on those savings (effectively, you “earn” interest by paying less on the loan, which is better than taxable savings interest). This structure encourages good saving habits even after taking a loan, and is ideal for borrowers who like to segment their money. The offset setup works for both individual and joint borrowers (if you have a 2Up joint account and joint savers, those can offset a joint loan as well). Up’s offset home loan feature was recognized as innovative and “award-winning” in the industry​
UP.COM.AU
.

Loan Types and Eligibility: Up Home Loans currently cater to owner-occupier borrowers with principal-and-interest repayments (the product is especially marketed to first home buyers). Loans are available for purchase or refinance of residential property. While detailed lending criteria aren’t published on the marketing pages, standard credit and lending criteria apply (income, credit history, and deposit requirements)​
UP.COM.AU
. Generally, a minimum 20% deposit (80% LVR) is ideal to avoid lender’s mortgage insurance, though customers with smaller deposits can still apply (Bendigo’s normal lending policies and LMI would apply for >80% LVR). At this stage, interest-only loans and investor loans are not front-and-center in Up’s offering – the focus is on owner-occupiers paying down their loan. The maximum loan amount and other such criteria depend on individual assessment. Borrowers need to be Australian residents and (in practice) Up customers, since the loan is managed via the Up app.

Fully Digital Process: Consistent with Up’s digital nature, the home loan application and management are handled online. Prospective borrowers can generate a personalized Key Facts Sheet from Up’s website for full fee and rate details​
UP.COM.AU
, then proceed to apply (initially via a web form or the app). The application can be done without visiting a branch – you upload documents and get updates through the app/online. Up’s team (in conjunction with Bendigo’s credit team) conducts the assessment. Once approved, the loan is integrated into your Up app alongside your accounts. You can manage the loan via the app: view the balance, make extra repayments or redraws instantly, and see interest saved by offsets. If you’re a two-player (joint) borrower, both of you can see and manage the loan in the shared 2Up space. Up also provides tools like loan calculators and learning resources (e.g. a guide “Understanding Home Loans” in simple language​
UP.COM.AU
 for first-timers). The goal is to make the home ownership journey as user-friendly as everyday banking.

Benefits and Notable Points: Up’s home loan aims to “bring everything you love about Up to a home loan”​
UP.COM.AU
. That includes transparency, low cost, and helpful tech features. For instance, you can get notifications when payments are received or due, and easily see your loan’s progress. Because of the multiple offsets, it effectively encourages you to keep using your Up accounts to manage money, blurring the line between everyday banking and loan management (which can simplify finances). The interest rates are very competitive for a big-bank-backed loan, and Up has indicated it will keep rates in line with market changes for fairness. The product has gained traction for its simplicity and was even described as a “digital loan you can handle yourself easily with no surprises”​
MOZO.COM.AU
 by financial commentators. It’s worth noting that since Up is part of Bendigo, customers get the assurance and stability of an established bank behind the scenes (and the loan falls under the same regulatory protections). In summary, Up Home Loans offer a modern mortgage experience: low rates, no junk fees, multiple free offsets, and intuitive app-based control. This has made it especially popular among younger, tech-savvy home buyers who were already fans of Up’s banking and now can continue the journey with their first home loan.

Security & Fraud Prevention
Up Bank leverages a security-by-design approach, with the advantage of being a mobile-only platform. Many traditional fraud risks are mitigated by Up’s model and the active measures in place:

Mobile-Only Access: Up does not have branches or standard online banking logins – your account is accessed exclusively through the secure mobile app on your registered device. This greatly reduces the risk of phishing or unauthorized access via website, since logging in requires your physical phone. To set up Up on a new device, one must authenticate via the registered phone number and a verification code, plus the account passcode/biometric. According to Up, a scammer would need your physical phone (or SIM) or the one-time code sent to it to even attempt access​
UP.COM.AU
. This 2-factor authentication (something you have: your phone, and something you know: your passcode) is baked into Up’s login process. The app itself can be secured with a PIN or biometrics (fingerprint/FaceID), and it automatically times out when not in use.

Card Security & Controls: The Up debit card is protected by Mastercard’s Zero Liability policy, meaning you won’t be held responsible for fraudulent charges if you safeguard your card. The Up app empowers users with card controls: you can instantly lock your card with a tap if it’s lost or suspected compromised, and unlock it anytime. You can also reset your card PIN in-app securely, which avoids having to visit a branch or ATM. Since the card details are accessible in-app, you never have to read them off the physical card to keep them safe (the card number can be copied from the app when needed for online purchases, and changed if necessary by ordering a replacement card). For online transactions, Up uses Mastercard SecureCode (SMS verification for certain risky transactions) to add an extra layer. All transactions trigger instant alerts, so if an unrecognized charge occurs, you’ll know within seconds and can take action.

Encryption and Infrastructure: All communication between the Up app and servers is encrypted. Being a modern bank, Up likely uses high-grade TLS encryption and securely stores data. Up’s banking infrastructure is actually cloud-based (hosted on Google Cloud Platform, as the company has mentioned in tech case studies), which allows them to quickly patch and update systems with the latest security fixes. Customer funds are held by Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, so the core ledger is backed by a regulated institution with robust security and compliance processes. Essentially, you get the benefit of a fintech’s agility with a big bank’s stability.

Scam Prevention & Customer Education: Up is proactive in protecting customers from scams and fraud. They have internal fraud detection systems that monitor for unusual activity or known scam patterns. In fact, Up recently piloted a new anti-fraud technology to enhance scam detection, complementing the existing measures that were already protecting its ~750,000 customers at the time​
UP.COM.AU
. (This likely refers to advanced machine learning systems or participating in industry initiatives to flag suspect transactions.) On the customer-facing side, Up emphasizes education: they run a series of blog posts and in-app messages called “Self-Defence Against Scammers” to teach customers how to spot and avoid common scams​
UP.COM.AU
. Topics include things like bank impersonation scams, phishing texts (e.g. the “Hi Mum” text scam), investment scams, etc. Up’s stance is that an informed customer is the best defense. They encourage skepticism of unsolicited calls/messages and explicitly warn that Up will never ask for your PIN or passcode via phone or text​
UP.COM.AU
. If someone claiming to be from Up does that, it’s a red flag. Up also advises customers to never share one-time SMS codes, and to contact them through official channels if in doubt.

Account Protection Policies: Because Up is under Bendigo’s umbrella, customers benefit from the same fraud protection policies as a traditional bank. If unauthorized transactions occur on your account or card, Up/Bendigo will investigate and typically reimburse you for proven fraud (as long as you haven’t been grossly negligent). Up participates in the New Payments Platform’s anti-fraud measures as well; for example, when you send money via PayID, the name of the recipient is shown for confirmation (to avoid misdirection scams). They likely also monitor large transfers and may delay or verify if something looks out of character (to protect against account takeover or scam coerced payments).

Device Security Features: Up’s app can only be installed on up-to-date Android and iOS devices, and it relies on the device’s security (for instance, it can block usage on a jailbroken/rooted phone which might be less secure). The app does not expose sensitive information without authentication. Additionally, Up uses real-time behavioral analytics (common in banking apps) to detect if a login or transaction seems abnormal (e.g., a new device login, or a transaction from a far location shortly after another – these might trigger additional verification).

In summary, Up’s security philosophy combines strong technology with user empowerment. By being app-only, they reduce many legacy vulnerabilities. They give users fine control (like instant card lock and real-time notifications) to act quickly. And they actively educate and inform about scams. A quote from Up’s security page captures their approach: “We will never ask you to disclose your PIN or passcode… Just say no, hang up, whatever it takes”​
UP.COM.AU
 – illustrating that Up wants customers to be vigilant. With these measures, Up has built a reputation for keeping accounts safe. Of course, deposits in Up (Bendigo) are covered by government guarantee up to $250k, so your money is not only secure from fraud but also from institutional failure. All things considered, Up provides a very secure banking environment, especially for a digital bank – leveraging modern tech and clear communication to prevent fraud.

Customer Support
Up Bank prides itself on responsive customer support that aligns with its digital nature. There are multiple channels to get help, and support hours are extensive to cover most of the day:

In-App Chat – “Talk to Us”: The primary support channel is the live chat built into the Up mobile app. By tapping “Talk to us” in the app, customers can start a chat with Up’s support team. This service is available from 6am to midnight (Victorian time) every day​
UP.COM.AU
. In-app chat is very convenient and typically you’ll get a response within minutes. Up’s support team is known to be friendly, helpful, and tech-savvy. They can assist with anything from transaction queries to technical issues. Since the chat is within the secure app, they already have context on your account (after identity verification) which speeds up troubleshooting. Many users report very positive experiences with Up’s chat support, often citing it as one of the best in banking (for example, customers on forums have noted Up’s support is “hands down the best ... seen from a bank”​
REDDIT.COM
). The chat also allows sending/receiving images, so you can share a screenshot if needed during support.

Email Support: If you cannot use the app (say your phone is lost or you’re locked out), or if you prefer email, you can contact Up via email at support@up.com.au. Email support is available as an alternative channel and is monitored by the same customer success team. You can expect prompt replies during business hours. It’s also the channel for more complex issues or when sending documents (though Up might often direct you to upload via secure links). Up typically replies within a day or even hours, depending on the query.

Phone Support: Uniquely for a digital bank, Up does provide a phone line for support: 1300 002 258. Phone support is offered during traditional hours (around 9am–5pm Victorian time on weekdays)​
UP.COM.AU
. This line is mainly for urgent issues or for those who can’t use the app (e.g., if your card is stolen and you have no app access, or other account lockouts). When you call, you’ll reach a real person from Up’s team. They may ask some security questions to verify you. While Up encourages using in-app chat for most things, it’s reassuring that a phone option exists if needed – something not all neobanks provide.

Self-Service and FAQs: Up maintains a comprehensive online Support Centre with FAQs and how-to guides on common topics. These are accessible on the Up website (support.up.com.au) and cover things like how to make payments, how PayIDs work​
UP.COM.AU
, card usage overseas, fixing login issues, etc. If you prefer finding answers yourself, this knowledge base is very useful. It’s searchable and contains step-by-step articles. Additionally, within the app, contextual help is provided for various features (for instance, explanations in settings or little tips that pop up for new users).

Community Engagement: Beyond formal support channels, Up has fostered a community of users (often nicknamed “Upsiders”). In its early days, Up invited customers to a public Slack group to discuss the app and suggest features. That has since evolved (they sometimes engage on social media and forums like Reddit’s r/UpBanking). While these aren’t official support channels, the Up team (including developers and execs) are known to interact with customers online, which creates a very approachable image. For example, Up’s co-founder and staff often answer questions and provide help on community threads. This means as a customer you have multiple avenues to get help or share feedback.

Response Times and Service Quality: Up’s support is designed to be fast and effective. The in-app chat generally responds within a few minutes during operating hours, and they work to resolve issues on the spot. Because everything is digital, the support team can quickly verify your identity and see your account info, making the interaction efficient. They often go the extra mile – e.g., helping dispute a transaction or guiding you through a feature in real-time. The support team is based in Australia and well-versed in the app’s functionality (often they’ve been with Up since the early days and have a passion for the product). According to Up, if you have a complaint or an issue that isn’t resolved immediately, they have an escalation process and aim to resolve complaints promptly (their site mentions acknowledging complaints within 1 business day and resolution as quickly as possible). Serious matters can be escalated to Bendigo’s ombudsman if needed, but such instances are rare due to the hands-on approach.

In essence, Up offers customer support that’s in tune with the expectations of modern app users – quick chat-based help at your fingertips, but also an option to talk to a human when you need to. The long support hours (6am to midnight) cover early mornings and late nights, which is convenient if you’re checking your finances outside 9-5. Whether it’s a simple query about how a feature works or an urgent issue like a lost card, Up has channels in place to assist promptly. The combination of in-app support and a high customer satisfaction reputation sets Up apart from many incumbent banks’ support experiences.

Company Overview & Culture
Up is an Australian digital bank (often called a neobank) that launched in October 2018​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
. It was born from a collaboration between Melbourne-based fintech company Ferocia and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, one of Australia’s established mid-tier banks. Essentially, Ferocia built the software and user experience, while Bendigo provided the banking license and balance sheet. From the start, Up’s mission has been to “make banking better for young Australians” by leveraging modern technology and design​
UP.COM.AU
. Up was the first mobile-only bank in Australia​
MI-3.COM.AU
, meaning it operates entirely via smartphone app without any branches or traditional online banking site.

Background and Founding: Up’s co-founders, Dom Pym and Grant Thomas, were the brains behind Ferocia (which had previously developed banking software like Bendigo’s mobile app). They envisioned a new bank that could fix pain points in personal finance – things like clunky interfaces, lack of spending insights, and surprise fees. With Bendigo’s backing, Up was built and rolled out to the public in late 2018. The launch was highly anticipated, and Up gained traction quickly, especially among millennials and tech-savvy users. By design, Up had a very different vibe from a traditional bank: it used bright colors, casual language, and even witty messages in-app, branding itself as a fun and friendly way to manage money. Early on, Up had an invite code system to manage growth, and it cultivated a community by inviting users to give feedback (they even had public Trello boards and Slack channels for feature requests). This approach helped Up build a passionate user base and iterate rapidly on features.

Growth and Acquisition: Up experienced rapid growth in its first few years. By mid-2021, it had around 400,000 customers, which grew to 750,000 by mid-2022​
UP.COM.AU
. Remarkably, by late 2024 Up reached the milestone of 1,000,000 customers​
MI-3.COM.AU
, making it one of the fastest-growing Australian banks in recent times. This growth was “unmatched by any other Australian bank” in that period​
MI-3.COM.AU
. The success of Up did not go unnoticed – in mid-2021, Bendigo and Adelaide Bank decided to acquire Ferocia outright to bring Up fully in-house. They announced a deal worth up to $116 million for Ferocia (and thereby the remaining ownership of Up)​
FST.NET.AU
. This acquisition, completed in 2021, meant that Up became a wholly owned part of Bendigo and Adelaide Bank. Despite the change in ownership structure, Up continued to operate as an independent brand with the same team and ethos, now under the umbrella of its parent bank. Bendigo’s CEO described the move as a way to “accelerate the bank’s digital strategy,” leveraging Up’s innovation for the wider group​
CROWDFUNDINSIDER.COM
. Importantly, Up’s users likely didn’t notice any change – the app and experience remained as it was, just backed by Bendigo more directly. Ferocia’s team joined Bendigo but kept focusing on Up (and other digital projects).

Culture and Values: Up’s culture is often described as tech-driven, customer-centric, and innovative. They have a relatively small team (“Team Up”) composed of engineers, designers, and product specialists mostly based in Melbourne. Up’s team has been known to be very passionate – as their site says, “a passionate team of engineers and creatives building the best mobile banking experience imaginable.”​
UP.COM.AU
. This startup-like culture meant they embraced new ideas and weren’t afraid to do things differently (for example, creating a public roadmap, or using playful branding rarely seen in finance). Up’s values focus on simplicity, transparency, and helping customers. The tagline they often use is “simplify money, amplify life” – implying that banking should not be a source of stress, but rather an enabler for life. Internally, they foster a culture of rapid development and continuous improvement (deploying app updates and new features frequently). The team often engages with customers to get feedback and identify pain points. Even as part of a larger bank, Up has maintained a distinct “fintech startup” vibe in its operations.

Partnerships and Ecosystem: Aside from the core partnership between Ferocia and Bendigo, Up has forged other partnerships to enhance its offerings. A notable one is with Wise for international transfers (as discussed, giving customers access to cheap FX transfers within the Up app). Up has also partnered with financial tools like government initiatives (they were one of the first to implement the Consumer Data Right/Open Banking APIs, allowing users to share data securely to budgeting apps). Additionally, Up has worked with payment platforms (enabling Apple Pay, Google Pay from day one, and more recently Samsung/Garmin Pay). On the home loan front, while Bendigo is the lender, Up’s tech might be leveraging a modern cloud-based loan origination system (possibly Ferocia built or a third-party like MOGOPLUS/Tic:Toc) to ensure the mortgage experience is digital. They also partnered with the budgeting app 1Password to allow easy yet secure sharing of bank statements for loan applications (a small example of fintech synergy).

User Community and Engagement: Up refers to its customers as “Upsiders”, creating a sense of belonging to a community. In its early years, Up held events and meetups – for instance, they celebrated their first birthday with a community event, and have been present at fintech meetups. They encourage users to interact on social media; Up’s Twitter and Instagram are quite lively with memes and updates. They even had an official podcast called “Upside” for a while, where team members discussed new features and answered questions. This open style of communication is part of Up’s culture of transparency. Another aspect is their public product roadmap – Up introduced “The Tree of Up” in 2019, a publicly accessible roadmap styled like a tech-tree, showing planned features and projects​
UP.COM.AU
. This was very unusual for a bank, as it essentially let customers see what was coming soon and what was being worked on. It included things like joint accounts, bill predictors, etc., and Up delivered on many of those items. The public roadmap (and subsequent updates on their blog) fostered trust that Up was listening and continuously evolving. It also fits their cultural value of “building with the community”.

Reputation and Brand: Up’s brand is youthful and approachable. They use a lot of neon orange (coral) in their branding and card, which really stands out compared to big bank blues. Their tone of voice is casual (e.g., calling transactions “da money in & outz” in some tooltips, or writing patch notes with emojis). This resonates with a younger demographic that may find traditional banks too stuffy. Up has received industry recognition for both its products and its brand. For example, the Up app won a 2021 Mozo Experts Choice Award for Exceptional Everyday Account​
UP.COM.AU
, and the design has been lauded with high App Store/Play Store ratings. In 2022, Up was ranked among the most trusted banking brands by some surveys (likely due to its transparency and Bendigo’s backing). Up’s marketing often highlights real customer stories and how features helped them save or manage money better, reinforcing the brand mission.

In summary, Up Bank is a fintech success story in Australia, blending startup innovation with bank-grade reliability. Founded in 2018 as a joint venture, it quickly grew to 1+ million users by focusing on a superior mobile experience for everyday banking. The culture at Up is all about “customer first” – from eliminating fees to adding clever features that genuinely help people. Their partnership with Bendigo Bank provided credibility and financial backing, while Ferocia’s tech DNA drove cutting-edge development. Even after full acquisition by Bendigo, Up continues to operate with its unique identity. The company’s values – simplicity, honesty, and empowerment – are evident in everything from their product design to their frank, informal way of communicating with customers. Up’s journey so far demonstrates how a strong culture and clear mission (to simplify banking) can result in a beloved brand. Going forward, as part of Bendigo, Up is positioned to keep innovating and perhaps influence how traditional banks approach digital banking.

Roadmap & Innovations
One of Up’s defining traits is its commitment to innovation and transparency in product development. Unlike traditional banks that keep plans under wraps, Up has openly shared its roadmap and involved customers in the journey.

“Tree of Up” – Public Roadmap: In early 2019, shortly after launch, Up introduced a public product roadmap called The Tree of Up​
UP.COM.AU
. This was visualized like a branching tech tree (inspired by video game style progression), showing features and improvements that were Planned, In Progress, or Recently Delivered. It was a novel way to communicate with users about what’s coming. Items on the roadmap included things like joint accounts, paycheck prediction (Pay Day), scheduled payments, bill splitting, international transfers, and more. By sharing this, Up set expectations and got users excited for upcoming features. The response was incredibly positive​
UP.COM.AU
 – customers felt heard and “in the loop.” Up updated the Tree of Up as items progressed or got released. This public roadmap approach was (and still is) quite unique in banking, showing Up’s transparent culture.

Continuous Feature Releases: Up follows a rapid development cycle, pushing out new features and enhancements regularly (often every few weeks). Over 2019-2021, Up rolled out a slew of features that had been promised on its roadmap:

Digital Cards & Wallets: At launch, Up already had Apple Pay/Google Pay ready (a first for an Aussie neobank in 2018). They quickly added more wallets like Garmin and Samsung Pay, staying ahead in terms of payment tech.
PayID/Osko Instant Payments: Up enabled PayID very early, allowing real-time payments when many bigger banks were still catching up. They also later added the ability to generate PayID QR codes for easy sharing.
Scheduled Payments & Direct Debits: Up introduced features to schedule future payments or set up repeating transfers (like paying rent or monthly transfers to Savers), and made managing direct debits easy (with notifications when first charged, etc.).
Bill Predicting & Pay Day: By mid-2020, Up had developed the Upcoming Bills prediction that watches for recurring transactions, and the Pay Day balance feature launched after that​
UP.COM.AU
. This gave users a forward-looking view of their money, an innovation that few banks had.
2Up Joint Accounts: One of the most requested features, joint accounts, was reimagined by Up as “2Up” and launched in 2021​
UP.COM.AU
. This was a major milestone on the roadmap delivered. It introduced new concepts (avatars for each spender, preserving individual accounts) that were innovative in joint banking.
Overdraft Alternatives (Covers): Up decided not to offer traditional overdrafts (with interest/fees), and instead built Covers & Forwards. By late 2021, they released these actions: Forward (move money to a Saver) and Cover (pull money from a Saver) quickly​
UP.COM.AU
. This essentially gave users fee-free control to handle accidental negative balances by self-funding from savings.
International Features: Up’s Wise integration for foreign transfers came in 2021, opening up cheap international payments within the app. And in 2022, Up removed the last remaining fee on travel by scrapping the $5 overseas ATM fee​
UP.COM.AU
, something that was likely planned on their roadmap’s “travel” improvements.
Enhanced Insights: Up continued improving its insights, adding custom date range selection in spending analytics​
UP.COM.AU
 and more personalization. They also introduced fun touches like monthly reports that compare your spending vs previous months, and even a yearly snapshot (some users got a “Year in Review” of finances).
Open Banking API: Up was one of the early banks to go live with Australia’s Consumer Data Right open banking. This means by 2020, Up customers could securely share their account data with accredited fintech apps (like budgeting apps) via API. It’s a behind-the-scenes innovation but important in the fintech ecosystem.
Essentially, Up has delivered a steady stream of improvements. Each year, they recap new features in blog posts (e.g., “Get to know the 2021 Line Up” and 2022 edition) celebrating what was added​
UP.COM.AU
. The company’s ability to push updates server-side or through frequent app releases means even features like interface tweaks or new categories appear seamlessly. Users often wake up to find a new feature enabled after an app update, with clear in-app explanation on how to use it.

Home Loan Innovation: A huge innovation for Up was translating its philosophy to home loans in 2022. Up leveraged technology (and Bendigo’s lending) to create a very fintech-style mortgage with features like instant online approval (for some), completely digital documentation, and the unique multiple offset accounts concept​
UP.COM.AU
. This showed Up’s willingness to tackle even complex financial products in a user-friendly way. Winning multiple awards in 2024 for its home loan products​
MOZO.COM.AU
 indicates that this approach is resonating and considered innovative in the industry. Going forward, we can expect Up to expand its home loan offerings (perhaps adding investor loans, offset for fixed portions, etc.) as well as possibly other credit products in a similarly innovative fashion (like personal loans or a buy-now-pay-later alternative, should they choose to explore those).

Upcoming and Future Plans: While Up no longer publicly shares a Trello board, they still hint at upcoming features through their community engagement and press releases. Some expected developments in the pipeline could include:

PayTo integration: PayTo is Australia’s upcoming direct debit replacement (real-time debit agreements). Up has indicated interest in new payment tech, so likely they will support PayTo for merchants and subscriptions once it becomes mainstream.
Expanded Investment/Wealth features: As of now Up doesn’t offer stock trading or crypto or anything, but being part of Bendigo, they might integrate simple investing options or partnerships (this is speculative, but many neobanks add wealth products as they mature).
Business or Teen Accounts: Up is currently personal-only (16+). In the future, they might consider products for under-16s (youth accounts with parental controls) or even small business accounts. However, no concrete info on this yet – their focus remains retail banking.
Web Banking: Some users desire a web interface for Up (for desktop access). Up historically said mobile-only was their strategy. It’s unclear if they plan to create a web portal; they haven’t so far, which suggests it may not be on the immediate roadmap.
Credit Card or Overdraft: Up has explicitly avoided credit cards or traditional overdrafts to encourage good financial habits. They seem more likely to stick with debit-based solutions (like the Covers feature) and home loans as their credit offering. So a credit card is probably not on the near roadmap, which aligns with their ethos of not pushing debt unnecessarily.
Up also keeps an eye on customer feedback. They often run early access or beta tests for features with volunteer users (e.g., the Auto-Covers Preview was tested by engaged users before full release​
UP.COM.AU
). This indicates that if something new is coming, some users might get a sneak peek to refine it. In recent times, Up’s parent Bendigo has mentioned integrating some of Up’s tech into the broader bank; conversely, Up might also inherit some capabilities from Bendigo (like offering insurance or other services through partnerships). But Up has stated they will only introduce things that make sense to their audience and will do so in their own style.

In terms of innovation, Up’s impact on the market is notable – competitors have had to up their game. Other banks have introduced better apps and features (for instance, CBA’s app added spending trackers, ING added insights, etc.) in response to fintechs like Up. Up often was first-to-market with things in Australia (first all-digital bank, first with digital onboarding in minutes, first with a public roadmap, among the first with fee-free international spending). They continue to iterate quickly.

Up’s philosophy on innovation can be summed up by their own words when launching the roadmap: “We’re excited to introduce a new kind of product roadmap... a technology tree-like view of our product plans”​
UP.COM.AU
. This excitement about building the future of banking is core to Up. They position themselves not just as a bank, but as a tech company that provides banking. As they grow, maintaining that pace is a challenge, but given their track record and the resources of Bendigo behind them, it’s likely we’ll see Up rolling out more cutting-edge features that keep users engaged. Customers can keep an eye on Up’s blog and social media for hints of “what’s coming next”, as the spirit of the Tree of Up lives on in how transparently they communicate updates.

Promotions & Campaigns
Up Bank has engaged in various promotions and marketing campaigns to attract new customers and reward existing ones. Here are some key promotions and campaigns that highlight Up’s approach to growth and customer engagement:

Referral Program – “Hook Up a Mate”: Up runs a referral scheme that incentivizes customers to invite friends. Both the referrer and the new customer (referee) receive a cash bonus deposited into their accounts when the new user signs up with a referral code and makes their first transaction. Initially, the bonus was around $5 each, but the program has become more generous over time. In 2023, Up increased the standard referral bonus to $10 for each party, and even ran limited-time boosts (e.g., $20 bonus per person during special promo periods)​
REDDIT.COM
​
OZBARGAIN.COM.AU
. Notably, Up’s referral bonus has a loyalty kicker: “Each year you remain an Upsider your referral bonus will grow”​
UP.COM.AU
 – meaning long-term customers can earn higher bonuses for referrals (to thank them for staying). For example, a customer in their second year might get $15 per referral instead of $10. This is a unique twist encouraging customer retention. The referral process is all in-app; you get a personal code to share, and you can track your successful referrals. This word-of-mouth strategy has been effective, as many of Up’s users enthusiastically recommend the app to friends for the bonus and for its genuinely good service.

Brand Campaign – “Simplify Money, Amplify Life”: In late 2024, Up launched its first major multi-channel brand campaign to reach a wider audience. The campaign’s tagline was “Simplify Money, Amplify Life”, encapsulating Up’s core purpose​
LBBONLINE.COM
. This slogan emphasizes that by using Up’s smart banking tools to simplify your finances, you can free yourself from money stress and focus on living your life. The campaign was created with advertising agency Thinkerbell and rolled out across TV, digital, outdoor, and social media. It showcased relatable scenarios of people managing their money effortlessly with Up and enjoying life’s moments. Up’s messaging in the ads was straightforward and positive, aligning with their vibrant brand image. A quote from Up about the campaign: “‘Simplify Money, Amplify Life’ cuts straight to our core purpose — using smart banking features to alleviate financial anxiety and empower our customers”​
BANDT.COM.AU
. This campaign not only aimed to attract new users by explaining Up’s benefits but also to strengthen the brand identity for existing users (making them proud to be part of a movement that “amplifies life”). It was timed to coincide with Up reaching 1 million customers, marking a new phase of maturity for the bank. The campaign significantly increased Up’s visibility in mainstream channels, beyond the organic growth they had via referrals and social media.

“The Upside” Cash Splash Promotion: To celebrate hitting the one-million-customer milestone in November 2024, Up ran a special one-off promotion called “The Upside Cash Splash.” This was a 5-day giveaway event where thousands of Up customers won cash prizes. Specifically, from Nov 25 to Nov 29, 2024, Up randomly rewarded customers each day with prizes deposited directly into their accounts​
FINANCIALNARRATIVE.ORG
​
LBBONLINE.COM
. The prize pool was substantial – across the five days, Up gave out thousands of prizes totaling a large sum (reportedly, tens of thousands of dollars in aggregate; one source hinted at possibly $1 million total, but the exact figure isn’t confirmed in our sources). Every morning during the promo, winners were notified in the Up app that they’d received an “Upside Cash Splash” bonus, and the funds were instantly available. The idea was to give back to the community of Upsiders who helped reach the milestone. Up advertised this in-app and on their socials, creating a lot of buzz as people shared about winning some free cash (many saw amounts like $5, $10, $50, and a few lucky ones got larger prizes). The campaign was very much on-brand for Up – a fun, surprise-and-delight way to celebrate together with customers, rather than, say, just running a generic ad. It also drove engagement, as customers had a reason to open their app each day to check if they won. T&Cs for the promo were provided (eligibility likely required being a verified active customer). The Upside Cash Splash exemplifies Up’s customer-first approach to promotions: instead of giving money to advertisers or middlemen, they literally gave it to their users.

Social Media and Community Promotions: Up has also done smaller-scale promotions, often via social media contests or community engagement. For example, they’ve run giveaways of Up merchandise (like their popular Up socks, T-shirts, or stickers) to users who participate in surveys or share posts. They sometimes do fun campaigns like a scavenger hunt or quizzes on Instagram stories where winners get gift cards. These aren’t as hefty as the cash campaigns, but they help keep the community engaged. Up’s tone on social media is playful; one campaign involved users sharing their Savers’ nicknames or their most-used emoji for a chance to win a little something. Moreover, Up has partnered with some events or fintech initiatives (like they sponsored a fintech meetup or a podcast) – those are more marketing initiatives than customer promos, but they increase brand presence.

Promotional Interest Rate Offers: Up’s saving interest has generally followed the market, but they haven’t really needed special promo rates (like some banks do introductory rates) – instead they keep a consistently high ongoing rate. There haven’t been short-term bonus rate promos; rather, Up’s strategy is the referral bonuses and value-add features as incentives. One could consider the competitive 4.35% saver rate itself a promotional point, as it’s among the higher rates from transaction-linked savings accounts, but it’s not a limited-time promo, it’s an ongoing offer (subject to meeting the criteria)​
MOZO.COM.AU
.

Public Relations and Education Campaigns: Up also engages in campaigns that are more about education than sales. For instance, they ran the “Stay Smart on Scams” content series (during National Scams Awareness Week) which, while not giving a monetary benefit, was a campaign to position Up as a safe bank and to help customers avoid fraud​
UP.COM.AU
. Similarly, Up’s blog sometimes runs financial wellness challenges (like saving $1000 challenge, etc.), encouraging customers to use Up’s features to achieve goals. These can be seen as soft promotions – they promote usage of the app’s features in a way that benefits the user’s finances.

Awards and Recognition (as Marketing): While not exactly a promotion to customers, it’s worth noting Up often shares news of the awards they win, which serves as a marketing tool. For example, when Up’s Everyday Account won the 2021 Mozo Experts Choice Award, they publicized that​
UP.COM.AU
. In 2024, after winning Mozo’s home loan awards, Up put out press releases and social media posts celebrating it​
UP.COM.AU
. This kind of communication reinforces to customers (and potential customers) that Up’s products are top-rated by experts, essentially saying “you’re banking with an award-winning institution.”

Overall, Up’s promotions strategy has been centered on rewarding users and amplifying positive word-of-mouth. They haven’t done gimmicky short-term rate offers or massive mass-media ad spends until recently. Instead, they relied on customers loving the product and referring friends (with a nice referral bonus as a thank you). This grassroots growth culminated in the million-user milestone, at which point they did broaden marketing with the “Amplify Life” campaign to capture even more of the market. Going forward, we can expect Up to continue a generous referral program (it’s been a key driver for them) and occasional special promotions tied to events (like major feature launches or milestones). Given their track record, any new campaign will likely reflect their brand ethos: straightforward, customer-centric, and a little bit playful. Whether it’s free cash drops, cool swag, or just improved product value, Up’s focus is on creating “happy Upsiders” who then organically spread the word about Up Bank`
